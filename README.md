# Spam_Filter

This is notebook for implementation of spam filter code which effectively predicts a spam mail. 

## Neural Network

This model is neural network based model and every code of NN is coded from the very basic. 
Back propogation, forward propogation, activation function, cost function and model is is coded from very basic with their mathematics involved and  gives a great solution.

## TF-IDF Vectorizer

TF-IDF Vectorizer is used in here which shows great results.
